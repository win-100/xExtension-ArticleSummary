# FreshRSS Article Summary Extension

This extension for FreshRSS allows users to generate summaries of articles using a language model API that conforms to the OpenAI API specification. The extension provides a user-friendly interface to configure the API endpoint, API key, model name, and a prompt to be added before the content. When activated, it adds a "summarize" button to each article, which, when clicked, sends the article content to the configured API for summarization.

## Features

- **API Configuration**: Easily configure the base URL, API key, model name, and prompt through a simple form.
- **Summarize Button**: Adds a "summarize" button to each article, allowing users to generate a summary with a single click.
- **Markdown Support**: Converts HTML content to Markdown before sending it to the API, ensuring compatibility with various language models.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback in case of API errors or incomplete configurations.
- **Smart Fallback**: Uses the article's description if the main content is empty or contains only images.

## Installation

1. **Download the Extension**: Clone or download this repository to your FreshRSS extensions directory.
2. **Enable the Extension**: Go to the FreshRSS extensions management page and enable the "ArticleSummary" extension.
3. **Configure the Extension**: Navigate to the extension's configuration page to set up your API details.

## Configuration

To configure the extension, follow these steps:

1. **Base URL**: Enter the base URL of your language model API (e.g., `https://api.openai.com/`). Note that the URL should not include the version path (e.g., `/v1`).
2. **API Key**: Provide your API key for authentication.
3. **Model Name**: Specify the model name you wish to use for summarization (e.g., `gpt-5-nano`).
4. **Prompt**: Add a prompt that will be included before the article content when sending the request to the API.

## Usage

Once configured, the extension will automatically add a "summarize" button to each article. Clicking this button will:

1. Send the article content to the configured API.
2. Display the generated summary below the button.

## History
- Version: 0.1.1 (2024-11-20)
  > **Bug Fix**: Prevented the summary button from affecting the title list display. Previously, the 'entry_before_display' hook was causing the summary button to be added to the title list, leading to display issues. Now, the button initially has no text and adds text only when the article is clicked to be displayed.
